(2 marks)\n*   **Student's Answer:** The student states that inductive bias is \"used in decision tree learning\" but fails to define what inductive bias *is*. The subsequent description focuses on the structural components of a decision tree (edges, parent/child nodes) rather than the underlying assumptions or principles of inductive bias within that context. There is no conceptual alignment with the definition provided in the key.\n*   **Marks Awarded:** 0/2\n\n**Q2. Mention different forms of learning.**\n*   **Teacher's Key:** Lists Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Semi-supervised learning, and Reinforcement learning.

The additional sentence about algorithms (Neural Network, Decision tree) is irrelevant but does not detract from the correctness of the primary answer.\n*   **Marks Awarded:** 2/2"
