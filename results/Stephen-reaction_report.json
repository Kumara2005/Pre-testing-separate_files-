All critical academic markers, including the correct reactant (nitrile), specific reducing agent system (SnCl2/HCl, 2[H]), the intermediate imine, the hydrolytic conditions (H3O+ is an acceptable and often more explicit representation of acidic hydrolysis than H2O+), and the final aldehyde and ammonia products, are accurately presented. The sequential depiction of the two-step transformation is chemically precise, indicating a thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism."
