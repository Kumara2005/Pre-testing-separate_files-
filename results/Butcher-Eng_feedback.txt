**Page 1 Feedback:**

Hi there!

You did a great job clearly expressing your personal preference for movies and providing a specific, engaging example with 'Seven,' which shows you're thinking about the topic! Your enthusiasm for visual storytelling is very clear.

However, your answer was primarily a personal reflection rather than an analytical comparison of the storytelling *mediums*. The prompt required discussing how books and movies *narrate* stories differently (e.g., books use internal thoughts, movies use visuals/sound). Your response focused more on personal enjoyment and time efficiency, rather than the core mechanisms of narration.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
Next time, try to analyze *how* each medium tells a story. For example, how do books convey a character's thoughts versus how movies show emotion visually? Focus on specific narrative techniques and the strengths/weaknesses of each format. Moving beyond personal preference towards objective analysis will significantly improve your answer.

Keep building on your clear communication and enthusiasm!
