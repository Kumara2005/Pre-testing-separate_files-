While they vaguely touch on movies being \"best thing to visualise\" and being shorter (2-3 hours), they fail to elaborate on the fundamental differences in internal vs. external focalization, psychological depth, or the specific narrative tools each medium employs. The \"theory\" mentioned is also vague and not well-integrated into a conceptual analysis of narration. The answer lacks conceptual accuracy and engagement with the core subject."
